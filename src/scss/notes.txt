// Media queries
// As best practice for media queries start with mobile widths and move ur way up 

// min width used for mobile first --- best to use this
// ex. min-width: 500px --- anything more than 500px wide

// max width used for desktop first
// ex. max-width:500px --- anything less than 500px wide

// best to assume all mobile devices are below 700px
// best to assume all tablets are 700px to 992 px
// best to assume small screens are 992 px to 1392 px
// best to assume large/Xl screens are greater than 1392 px

// best to keep media queries simple within a set range
// stick to one set
// so that you are not overcomplicating things 

// em relative to the font-size of the element ( 2em means 2 times the size of the current font )

// rem relative to the font-size of the root element 

// IMPORTANT ====================================================================================================

// USE EM for MEDIA QUERIES
// why use em with media queries breakpoints
// for accessibility purposes
// units like em and rem are relative to other factors on the pages --- em is relative to the base font size --- will give user control --- stop using pixels as pixels are absolute

// USE REM for Font Sizes. 
--- Relative to font-size of the ROOT ELEMENT

// USE EM FOR PADDING and stuff like that.
--- Relative to the font-size of CONTAINER
